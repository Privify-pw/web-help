# Getting Started with Privify

Welcome to Privify! This guide will help you understand the platform and get started quickly.

## What is Privify?

Privify is a secure personal data management platform that gives you complete control over your information. With end-to-end encryption and biometric authentication, your data stays private and secure.

## Key Features

### 🔐 End-to-End Encryption
All your personal data is encrypted using military-grade encryption. Only you have access to your decryption keys.

### 🔑 Biometric Authentication
Use Touch ID, Face ID, or Windows Hello to securely unlock your data without remembering passwords.

### 📊 Data Organization
Organize your information into categories like Identity, Addresses, Education, and more.

### 🤝 Secure Sharing
Share specific data with companies and organizations while maintaining full control over what you share.

### 🔄 Data Portability
Export your data anytime in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, PDF).

## Getting Started

### 1. Create Your Account
Sign up with your email address and create a secure password. This password is also used for encryption, so make it strong!

### 2. Set Up Encryption
After signing in, you'll be prompted to set up encryption for your data. This is a one-time setup that ensures your data is always protected.

### 3. Enable Biometric Authentication (Optional)
For convenience, enable biometric authentication to unlock your data using your fingerprint or face.

### 4. Add Your Information
Start adding your personal information. Organize it into categories for easy management.

### 5. Respond to Requests
When companies request your information, you'll receive notifications. Review and respond to these requests securely.

## Understanding Portals

Privify has three main portals:

### User App (`/app`)
Your personal space to manage your data, respond to requests, and control your privacy settings.

### Company Portal (`/company`)
For organizations to create data contracts, send requests, and manage user submissions.

### Admin Portal (`/admin`)
For system administrators to manage the platform, companies, and data structures.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Use a Strong Password**: Your password is your encryption key. Make it strong and unique.
2. **Enable 2FA**: Add two-factor authentication for extra security.
3. **Save Recovery Codes**: Keep your recovery codes in a safe place.
4. **Regular Backups**: Export your data periodically for backup purposes.
5. **Review Sharing**: Regularly review what data you've shared and with whom.
